<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<div id = "header2">

    <p>"I'm not saving the world. I just kill goblins." Rumor has it that,
    in a certain guild in the middle of nowhere, there is an extraordinary man who has climbed all the way to the Silver rank just by killing goblins.
    At the same guild, a priestess who's just become a new adventurer has formed her first party...
    and the man who ends up rescuing that party when they get into trouble is none other than the Goblin Slayer.</p>
    <br/>
